RUN project terraform with command below
1. Config aws credentials to excute manage resources via aws-cli and terraform

        aws configure
2. run terraform plan file to plan create, update, destroy resources:

       ./terraform-plan.sh
3. run terraform apply file to apply create, update, destroy resources:

       ./terraform-apply.sh
## Introduction:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a powerful approach to managing and provisioning computing resources through machine-readable configuration files rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. Terraform, an open-source IaC tool developed by HashiCorp, enables developers to define and provision infrastructure in a consistent, repeatable, and automated manner. For this Music Serverless Application project, Terraform will be used to manage the entire AWS infrastructure, ensuring seamless deployment, scaling, and maintenance.

**Key Features of Terraform:**

+ Declarative Configuration: Terraform uses a high-level configuration language (HCL) that allows users to define what the infrastructure should look like rather than how to build it.
+ Infrastructure Planning: Terraform generates an execution plan, showing what actions will be taken to reach the desired state, providing a clear and transparent workflow.
+ Dependency Management: Terraform automatically handles dependencies between resources, ensuring they are created, updated, and destroyed in the correct order.
+ State Management: Terraform maintains a state file to keep track of the current infrastructure, enabling accurate and efficient updates.
+ Modularization: Terraform supports the use of modules, reusable components that simplify complex configurations and promote best practices.
+ Necessary Resources:

To set up the AWS infrastructure for the Music Serverless Application, the following resources will be defined and managed using Terraform:

**Compute Resources:**

+ Amazon Fargate: For deploying and running containerized backend services without managing servers.

**Database:**

+ Amazon Aurora MySQL: A highly available and scalable database solution for storing application data.

**Caching:**

+ Amazon ElastiCache (Redis): For improving application performance through caching.

**Networking:**

+ VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): For creating a secure and isolated network for the application.

+ Subnets: For organizing and segregating resources within the VPC.

+ Internet Gateway: For enabling internet access to the application.

**Load Balancing and Auto Scaling:**

+ Application Load Balancer (ALB): For distributing incoming traffic across multiple targets.

+ Auto Scaling Group: For automatically scaling the number of instances based on demand.

**Security:**

+ Security Groups: For controlling inbound and outbound traffic to resources.

+ IAM Roles and Policies: For managing permissions and access control.

**Development Process:**

**Setup Terraform:**

+ Install Terraform on the local development environment.

+ Configure AWS credentials and region settings.

**Define Resources:**

+ Create Terraform configuration files (.tf files) to define all required AWS resources.

+ Specify resource attributes and dependencies.

**Initialize Terraform:**

+ Run terraform init to initialize the Terraform working directory and download provider plugins.

**Plan and Apply:**

+ Execute terraform plan to generate and review the execution plan, ensuring the desired changes are correct.

+ Apply the configuration using terraform apply, provisioning the specified resources in AWS.

**Manage State:**

+ Use a remote backend (e.g., AWS S3) to store the Terraform state file, enabling collaboration and state management across teams.

**Modularization:**

+ Break down the configuration into reusable modules for better organization and maintainability.

+ Use module inputs and outputs to parameterize configurations and enable reusability.

**Output and Variables:**

+ Define variables to parameterize configurations, making them flexible and reusable.
+ Use output values to extract and share information about the resources created.

**Version Control:**

Store Terraform configurations in a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate with team members.
